# Execution times based on time complexity

One of the first exercises that appear in the book is:

Given the timeframes: second, minute, hour, day, month, year, century, determine biggest size 'n' of problem that can be solved in each time frame, considering that each run takes f(n) microseconds

Compute it for each f(n) below: 
- lg(n)
- sqrt(n)
- n
- n * lg(n)
- n^2
- n^3
- 2^n
- n!

While it's easy to solve each case individually with math, in this guide we generalize the problem to solve for
f(n)s not defined above. Of course it is not appliable to any function.
